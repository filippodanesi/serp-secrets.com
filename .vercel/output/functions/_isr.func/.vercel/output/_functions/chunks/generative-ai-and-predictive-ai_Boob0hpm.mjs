These can range from written texts, like articles or poems, to digital artworks, music, and even three-dimensional models. One of the most popular examples of generative AI is [GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10435) (_Generative Pretrained Transformer_), a series of language models that can **produce texts of remarkable coherence and creativity**.\n\nThe strength of generative AI lies in its ability to **\"learn\" from large amounts of data**, then use this information **to create new and original content**. However, this power is not without challenges. The quality and originality of the generated content can vary greatly depending on the amount and quality of the training data.
