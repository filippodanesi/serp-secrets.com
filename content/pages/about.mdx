Hey, I'm Filippo!

I work in Zurich as a Content Manager SEO at Triumph International, where I develop content strategies and figure out how [AI](/categories/artificial-intelligence/) keeps breaking everything we thought we knew about SEO.

I've been doing this SEO thing for a while now, helping businesses figure out why their websites aren't showing up on Google. Turns out, it's usually more complicated than they think (and sometimes simpler than I make it sound).

These days, I'm mostly fascinated by how **[SEO strategies](/categories/seo-strategies/)** intersect with AI, and how we're all just trying to keep up with Google's latest algorithm mood swings. I also dive into **[Technical SEO](/categories/technical-seo/)** when things get really nerdy. I write about strategies that actually work, sprinkled with the occasional existential crisis about whether we're all just feeding the machine.
